Sample code challenge - Search for Kits functionality.
User enters their Kit Label ID and selects from the autocomplete list to get shipping data (fake FedEx numbers are being used, so they don't return any actual shipping data when the FedEx page is opened!)

## To Run this App

From the project root, run this command:

### `npm run dev`
This will install all packages for backend and frontend, start the Express server (which provides a mini "API" serving requested data at the `/kits` endpoint), starts the React client, and opens a browser to http://localhost:3000
